        <h4>
            Early Stage 1:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>&quot;Feely bag&quot;. 
                Students are blindfolded and have to reach into a bag and identify an object. 
                Bring in concepts of big/small, long/short, heavy/light, how many?<br />
                Senses: what type of texture does the object have? What does it smell like? Does 
                it make a noise when you rattle it?</li>
            <li>Read a story to 
                the students without pictures and then have them draw aspects of the story from 
                how they imagined the characters or location might look. When students are 
                finished show them the visual text (illustrations) in the book and compare with 
                the pictures they drew.</li>
            <li>A teacher plays a 
                recording of various sounds, e.g. birds, wind in the trees; urban sounds such as 
                traffic, sirens, or alarms. What sounds can you hear? Where might you be? 
                Discuss how someone who can&#39;t see might use their hearing to stay safe and 
                navigate through the environment.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Stage 1</h5>
        <ul >
            <li>Catch and throw a 
                bell-ball under blindfold.</li>
            <li>Have the students 
                close their eyes and identify a familiar sound within the room - fan, pencil 
                sharpener, clock.</li>
            <li>Creative writing 
                exercise from different perspectives: volunteer puppy raiser bringing the dog 
                back to Guide Dogs after a year; Guide Dog instructor; blind person meeting his 
                or her Guide Dog for the first time.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Stage 2</h5>
        <ul >
            <li>Scenario to 
                discuss. You are walking down the street. On the corner is a woman with a long 
                guiding cane and she looks unsure or confused. What would you do? Discuss 
                appropriate ways to help, e.g. offer verbal assistance. If giving directions use 
                concrete terms like left and right from the woman&#39;s point of view.</li>
            <li>Blind cricket. 
                Have students try batting, bowling or fielding under blindfold using a ball with 
                a bell.</li>
        </ul>
